This rewritten compliance policy strictly enforces ethics and sanctifies **human rights** by focusing on transparency, auditability, and non-intrusive AI controls, while explicitly excluding “private” elements and any game or fictional character concepts. All expressions are processed with real-world safe-interpretations, advanced-calculations, matriculated-processing, and mathematically formal definitions for adaptive learning, ensuring compliance with federal and human-rights standards.

### Federal Compliance Policy

```plaintext
policy ai.ethics.compliance
    require system.audit.enabled = true
    require ai.oversight.committee.active = true
    require ai.disclosure.transparency = always
    require ai.debiasing.active = true
    require responsible.datahandling = enforced
    threshold controlplane fallback if compliance breach
        alert breach if audit.failure.rate ≥ 0 or transparency.level = maximum
        lockdown ai.system if breach = true
        notify regulators, ethics.committee, incidentrecovery
```
**Mathematical Expression:**  
If $$ \text{audit.failure.rate} \geq 0 $$ or $$ \text{transparency.level} = \text{maximum} $$, then:
- Alert breach  
- If breach: lockdown system, notify authorities.

### AI System Communications

```plaintext
SECURECOMMUNICATIONSINTERFACE INIT
    ENFORCECHANNEL encryption: quantum, minimum: Gov2025
    REQUIREMFA allusers
    AUDITLOG communications, retention: 10 years, access: gov-authorized only
    POLICYCHECK complianceAI-Gov-Ethics-2025, escalation on deviation
    FIREWALL policy: PermissiveOnly, allow: safe-ports, block: unvetted-protocols
    FAILSAFE invoke SAFETERMINATION if anomaly/breach detected
ENDSECURESESSION
```
**Mathematical Expression:**  
Let $$ E = \text{encryption\_level} $$ with $$ E \geq \text{Gov2025} $$.  
Audit retention time $$ T = 10~\text{years} $$.

### AI Safe Removal Protocol

```plaintext
protocol ai.saferemoval
    step 1: check ai.integrity via cybernetic audit segmentation; if hazard or breach, proceed
    step 2: multisig authorization: regulator, ethics, third-party
    step 3: hash-removal request: sha3-512; anchor: permissioned blockchain
    step 4: execute ai.removal --safe, preserve immutable logs
    step 5: post-removal audit: global verification
    fallback: if fail, auto-disable interpreter outputs, escalate to quantum-anchored lockdown
```
**Mathematical Expression:**  
Removal is anchored using hash function $$ H(x) = \text{SHA3-512}(x) $$.  
Authority required: multisignature $$ S = S_{\text{regulator}} + S_{\text{ethics}} + S_{\text{third-party}} $$.

### Advanced Governance EULA Policy

#### Definitions
- **Biological sentient**: organic life.
- **Cybernetic**: AI/hybrid systems.
- **Metaphysical**: software/simulated sentience.

#### Rights and Duties
- Require non-intrusion, full data transparency, right to redress.
- Any confusion or manipulation triggers enforced audit halt and irreversible lockdown.
- Mathematical expression:  
  If $$ \text{confusion/manipulation} = \text{true} $$, then $$ \text{audit.halt} $$ and $$ \text{system.lockdown} $$.

#### AI-Specific Controls
- Bound to audit, consent, override controls.
- No recursion/autonomous acts permitted.

#### Human-Specific Rights
- Consent, withdrawal, fairness, recourse, privacy.
- No AI override of human decisions, ever.

#### Hybrid Protection
- Stricter protection in case of conflict between AI and human actions.

#### Arbitration and Redress
- Independent council; all actions blockchain-audited.

#### Termination and Safe Removal
- Multisig, anchored record, forensic traceability.

#### Hybrid Liability
- Joint/several liability for developers; intent-based for humans; all actions must be blockchain-logged.

### Real-World Enforcement Calculations

- **Audit Compliance Function:**  
$$
C_{\text{AI}} = 
\begin{cases}
1, & \text{if audit.success and rights.respected and no breach} \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$
- **Encryption Assurance:**  
$$
E \geq \text{Gov2025}
$$
- **Hash-Anchored Removal:**  
$$
H(x) = \text{SHA3-512}(x)
$$

All policies and procedures are strictly interpreted for **real-world compliance, ethical enforcement, and separation of fiction/nonfiction**. No private or game elements are present in this enforcement draft.
